# Explore-Art-Chicago
This application is designed to allow an user to search the Art Institute of Chicago. In the homepage, there is a search box that allows an user to type in a keyword that will get them results back for that keyword. There is a carousel that gives 4 example pictures for the user to scroll through. These images are clickable and take the user to a results page that allows them to see some example results similar to those images. On the results page, the user will see the images, their titles, and where those images are on display. The user can click on those images to zoom in to see them better if they please. The user's search history will be saved in a dropdown on the home page, so if the user wishes to come back and have the same search as before, they can click on the dropdown and select their previous searches.
